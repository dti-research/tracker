## Experiments

Experiments are, like projects, defined in yaml configuration files. You can
create your experiment files manually or invoke
`tracker experiments create NAME`.

```yaml
- experiment: vgg16
  description: Using Tracker to do good science!
  operations:
    train:
      main: src/train.py
      seed: 42            # [optional]
      parameters:         # [optional]
        batch_size:
          description: Number of images pr. batch
          value: 32
        lr:
          description: Learning rate
          min: 1e-4
          max: 0.1
        [...]
      test:
        main: ...
        description: ...
        [...]
```

Experiments are linked from the project configuration file `tracker.yaml`
located at the root of the project (auto-generated by Tracker).

```yaml
experiments:
- vvg16:
    path: experiments/vgg16.yaml
- vgg32:
    path: experiments/vgg32.yaml
[...]
```

## Remotes

Remotes are defined either in the global Tracker configuration file
(`~/.tracker/config.yaml`) or for project specific remotes; in the root of the
project directory (`[...]/tracker.yaml`).

Each remote is named under the `remotes` section key.

```yaml
remotes:
  remote-1:
    ...
  remote-2:
    ...
  remote-n:
    ...
```
